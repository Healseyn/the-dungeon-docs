# Your damage

Your damage is the most important part of The Dungeonâ€”without it, no monster can be defeated, no matter how many times you click.

In the status bar, you can see exactly how your damage is calculated.\

{% hint style="info" %}
DAMAGE = ($DUNGEON/1000) \* LVLbonus
{% endhint %}

This means your damage is based on your level and the number of tokens you have in your wallet at that moment.

**more tokens in your wallet = more damage**\
**higher level = more damage**\
\
Each level gives you a 10% damage bonus, so yes leveling up is important.
