Players earn tokens based on the damage they deal to monsters. In addition, you can cast spells that manipulate the monster’s health and might even disrupt competitors who are fighting for a share of the monster’s loot.\


### Your damage is equal to your token balance

No custody, no transactions needed, your damage is equal your wallet balance, everytime you click the monster , the damage you see is equivaleted as your $DUNGEON token in your wallet, if you need more damage just hold more tokens, if you dont want more damage, just send the tokens to a friend\
