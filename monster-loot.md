# Monster loot



The **Monster Reward Pool** is the heart of the loot distribution system in **The Dungeon**. Each time a monster is defeated, players are rewarded with $DUNGEON tokens from this centralized reward system based entirely on the damage they dealt.

### How Does the Reward Pool Work?

The reward pool is directly linked to a special wallet on the Solana blockchain:

```

```

Every time a monster is slain, **5% of all tokens** stored in this wallet are automatically distributed among players who participated in the battle.

The distribution is **proportional** to the damage each player has inflicted on the monster. Simply put:

> **The more damage you deal, the bigger your share of the loot!**

***

### Practical Example

Imagine the reward pool currently contains **100,000 $DUNGEON tokens**. Once a monster is defeated, **5% of this amount (5,000 tokens)** will be distributed among the players.

If you personally dealt **10% of the total damage**, you’ll instantly receive **500 tokens (10% of the 5,000 tokens)** directly into your wallet.

### Tracking and Claiming Rewards

* **Automatic Transfers:**\
  Your rewards are automatically transferred to your wallet once you reach at least **5,000 pending tokens**. No manual action required!
* **Reward History:**\
  Curious about your past earnings? Check your reward history anytime by clicking on the circular button located at the bottom-left corner of your screen. This feature lets you track exactly how many tokens you’ve earned and when they were distributed.

### Growing the Reward Pool

The reward pool grows constantly as players cast spells. Every time a player spends tokens to cast a spell, **the entire amount spent** is sent directly to the reward wallet, boosting future monster loot for all active players.

Additionally, the first **0.5 SOL** raised at launch was added to a liquidity pool on the **Meteora** platform. **All rewards generated by this liquidity pool are automatically redirected to the game’s reward pool**, continually increasing the available loot for players.

This creates a healthy loop:

* Players use spells to strategically influence battles
* Tokens spent go directly into the reward pool
* Liquidity rewards from Meteora further boost the reward pool
* Monsters become more rewarding, encouraging even more engagement and strategic play

### Loot, Tokens, and XP

In addition to tokens, you’ll also earn experience points (**XP**) for each battle you participate in, helping you level up. Higher levels grant additional damage bonuses, further increasing your earnings potential in future fights.

Keep fighting, keep clicking, and secure your share of the reward pool to become one of the top warriors in The Dungeon!
