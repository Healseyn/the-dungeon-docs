How Spells Work

To cast a spell, simply send the required amount of $DUNGEON tokens (the spellâ€™s cost) to the special spell address

&#x20;in the game. Once your transaction is received, your chosen spell will be instantly cast on the monster. All spells are triggered by sending tokens to this same address.\

Each spell has a different effect and a different token cost. Use them wisely

### Why Spells Are Essential

* **Boost the Reward Pool:** Every time a player casts a spell, the entire $DUNGEON token cost is added directly to the reward pool. This means that all tokens spent on spells become part of the loot that players will compete for when the monster is defeated.
* **Big Impact:** Spells can drastically alter the course of battle, dealing massive damage or even healing the boss to prolong the fight.
* **Tactical Advantage:** Strategic use of spells can help you secure a bigger share of the loot, especially in tight competitions.

Spells not only keep battles exciting and unpredictable, but also ensure that active players help grow the rewards for everyone. Mastering when and how to use spells is a key part of maximizing your gains in The Dungeon.\
